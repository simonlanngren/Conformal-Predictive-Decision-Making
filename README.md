## Getting Started

### 1. Create a New Environment
It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

#### Using `venv`:
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required packages from `requirements.txt`:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You're now ready to use the project!
